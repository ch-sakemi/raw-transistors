## How it works

Just raw NMOS and PMOS transistors

## How to test

ua[0] and ua[1] are connected to source and drain of MOSFETs (NMOS1, NMOS2, and PMOS1).
The length/width are 0.25um/1.0um for all MOSFETs. 
ua[2] for the gate bias for NMOS1, ua[3] for the gate bias for NMOS2, and ua[4] for the gate bias for PMOS1.
Set the bias voltages, then measure the current. 

## External hardware

List external hardware used in your project (e.g. PMOD, LED display, etc), if any
